Webhosting steg för steg
    1: Request to IP and Port:
    When you enter the IP address and port in a web browser (e.g., http://your_server_ip:port), it sends an HTTP request to that address and port combination.
    
2: Server Response:    
    Your server, configured with a web server like Nginx or Apache, receives the HTTP request. The server then processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.

  3: HTML Content:
   If you've configured your server to serve an HTML file (e.g., index.html) in response to requests to that IP and port, the response will contain the HTML content of that file. This     HTML content is what the web browser interprets and displays as a web page.

   4: Web Browser Rendering:
    The web browser receives the HTML content from the server and renders it as a website. This includes displaying text, images, links, and any other elements defined in the HTML file.
